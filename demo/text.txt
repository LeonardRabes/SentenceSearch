Morphologic plasticity of varying plant organs is a major contributing factor to general plant fitness. Most higher plants can adapt to a multitude of outside stimuli by utilizing different phenotypes of the same basic structures [1]. Using simple methods (here photography and microscopy), it was possible to demonstrate that especially temperature, light influx and surrounding relative air humidity have mayor effects on the overall build on the plants observed. In our study we focused on the leaves of Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn. which have to undergo major morphological changes during the plant’s lifetime, necessitated through its comparative height difference between sapling and fully grown tree. It was possible to show, that changes to the leaf’s phenotype in direct reaction to gradient stimuli of a given location were made. Leaf shape, size, venation, layer thickness and stomatal density varied broadly depending on the observed specimen and/or the leaf’s position on the given tree. It can be hypothesized that these adaptations are made in an effort to conserve resources, optimize photosynthetic turnover or protect the plant from a given harmful outside factor. This result is consistent with similar findings in this field [2;3] and will serve as a steppingstone to further understand how plants use phenotypic plasticity to cope with an array of challenges.
